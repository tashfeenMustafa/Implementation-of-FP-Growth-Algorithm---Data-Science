# Implementation of FP Growth Algorithm - Data Science/Data Mining
An implementation of the FP Growth Algorithm in Data Science in Python. This algorithm is commonly used to mine frequent itemsets from Transactional Databases.

Data Repository: http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/

Experiment on the following datasets:
- Mushroom
- Chess
- Retail
- Pumsb

This algorithm takes input the minimum support (min_sup) and the name of the dataset under consideration and returns the average transaction length and the number of transactions in total along with a text file of all the frequent itemsets in the dataset.
